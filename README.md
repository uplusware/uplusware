# Hello world 👋
- My personal website: http://uplusware.net :point_left:
- The poem **Chang Ge Xing**(The long Song Ballad) of the Han Dynasty(B.C.202 ~ D.C.220) is probably one of the earliest Chinese poems expressing a moral sense of time. It's one of my favorite poems :thumbsup:

```
          《长歌行》
　　青青园中葵，朝露待日晞。
　　阳春布德泽，万物生光辉。
　　常恐秋节至，焜黄华叶衰。
　　百川东到海，何时复西归？
　　少壮不努力，老大徒伤悲。
  
  In the garden, the morning dew on the chinese mallow is gone after the sun rise.
  The spring's sunshine brings up everthing, and they live very well.
  But I'm often afraid of that the autumn comes since all the leaves turn yellow and falls at that time.
  All the rivers flow to sea, but when will they come back?
  You will not regret it when you are old if value time when you are young.(A lazy youth, a lousy age.)
